    Purchase a brand of food with high-quality ingredients. You could also make your own dog food. Don't feed your dog too much sugar, fried food, or other treats for people. These will harm your dog's health over time. NEVER feed a dog chocolate, grapes, raisins, onions, garlic, or products containing xylitol (used in many sugar-free products).
Generally, large breed dogs should be fed a large-breed puppy formula until they are around one year of age. They then should be transitioned to an adult diet until changing to a senior diet at around six years of age. Small and medium breeds should be fed puppy formula until around one year of age when they should be changed to an adult diet.
If a young dog becomes overweight it is fine to switch them to adult food (which is less calorific) before they are 12 months old.
