The Oxford Dictionary defines the word habit as “a settled or regular tendency or practice, especially one that is hard to give up.” We often think of ‘bad’ habits when we hear that word, however we can use the very nature of a habit to our advantage by integrating good ones!

If you want a healthier, more fit body and happier, healthier mind, this article is for you! Here are 25 habits divided into different categories to give you a healthier, happier life.
Fuel Your Body
1. WATER FIRST THING
Hydration is so important, and while many of us think of a hot cup of coffee or tea first thing in the morning, we are better off to start our day with a big glass of water. This helps to hydrate, lubricate joints, kickstart gastrointestinal tract movement, increase mental alertness, among other things.

Room temperature or warm water is best first thing in the morning, prior to breakfast, coffee or tea.

Tip: Drink your glass of water as soon as you hop out of bed, then hop in the shower while the coffee is brewing!

2. MORE VEGGIES
Many physicians, dieticians and health specialists (including me) believe that a healthy diet should be based on a foundation of varied vegetables and fruits.

A wide variety of fruits and vegetables is essential to get most of the required vitamins, minerals and nutrients our bodies need daily. Not to mention most fruits and vegetables are low in calories and fat, thus aiding in maintaining a healthy weight while helping us to feel full.

Tip: When meal planning, start with a vegetable or fruit, and build your meal around it!

3. DON’T SUCCUMB TO FADS
There are so many fads in the diet and fitness industry that it is hard to determine what is true and what is not. One thing that has stood the test of time is that fruits and vegetables are a staple.

There are healthy fats that our bodies require, and others that are detrimental in large quantities. Diets that are extremely strict and leave no room for indulgence, often leads to psychological disappointments and guilt – something which should not be part of a diet.

Tip: Eat well and enjoy!
