02/6The nutrition

Bhindi is known to be low in calories but rich in dietary fibre, vitamins, and minerals. Okra is an excellent source of vitamin C, vitamin K, and folate. It also provides small amounts of essential nutrients like potassium, magnesium, and calcium. Additionally, okra contains antioxidants and has been linked to potential health benefits, including improved digestion and reduced risk of certain chronic diseases

03/6Tips to keep in mind before buying okra

If you want to keep okra fresh for a long time, it is most important to keep a few things in mind while buying them. Okra should be soft, and also not have too many seeds. To get an idea of this, try pressing the okra lightly with your fingers. If you buy fresh okra in advance then it will be easy to store it. While buying okra, you can find out from its size and colour whether it is artificially farmed or indigenous okra. Small sized okra is indigenous. The best okra is Pusa A-4, which is medium in size and dark green in colour. This type of okra has less gluten, due to which it tastes good and can be stored for many days.


04/6Tips to store Okra

To keep okra fresh for a long time, it should be kept away from moisture. When you buy okra, first spread it and dry it so that the water on it dries up. If there is even a little water in the vegetable, it spoils quickly. Wrap the Bhindi in a dry cloth and keep it in an airtight container. So that moisture does not come into the okra. Due to this, okra does not spoil quickly.


05/6How to keep Bhindi in the fridge

If you are keeping okra in the fridge, then keep it in a polythene or vegetable bag and keep it in the fridge. Next, make 1-2 holes in it to keep it fresh. If you want to keep okra in the vegetable basket of the fridge, then first spread newspaper or paper in the veg basket, and then arrange the okras one by one. With this, the water from the vegetable will drain out on the paper and it will remain fresh.



06/6Ways to protect Bhindi from rotting

Do not keep okra with any other vegetable or fruit which is moist. Due to this, both of them will get spoiled quickly. Prepare vegetables and consume them on time. You may be able to prevent vegetables from getting spoiled when stored for a long time, but their taste does not taste good as they lose freshness and lose their nutritional value.
